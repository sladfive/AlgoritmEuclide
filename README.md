# AlgoritmEuclide
To see if two numbers are Coprimi we use Euclid's Lemma, let's first see what it is about and then we'll see its algorithm

Euclid's lemma
Euclid's so-called Lemma is nothing more than a generalization of Proposition 30 of Book VII called the Elements of Euclime.

Statement
This lemma asserts that

Let n have the characteristics of being an integer and positive which divides the product of two numbers  a  and  b , which have the property of being both integers and positive, and which are coprime with one of the two, then in this case the lemma states that it is also a divisor of the other number.

Putting the sentence in mathematical formulas we have that

If  n | ab  and  GCD ( n ,  a ) = 1 then  n | b .

you can found an example on  https://www.noirsolutions.net/esempi/php/Euclide/index.php

Here i put the full code that i 've used to create the example
